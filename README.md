This is just a Big Bar Strategy with a simple logic and without much technical and chart reading.

-- If we get a big bar candle of 12 - 18 points without large wigs, and it bisects the 9 EMA line, take a trade in that direction

-- Try to keep stoploss of size of the previous candle and a target of 1.25 of stoploss. 

-- On backtesting got a Strike rate of around 52%, but with stoploss trailing you can enlarge the RR ratio and thus maximize the profits.

So, these were the results on last a time period of around 4 months of backtesting, trading with 2 lots (100 quantity) a profit of 43k was generated before brokerage which is quite a handsome profit trading with just 2 lots (use 5-6 ITM options for best results as they have high delta).

PS - This was my first scripted backtesting, so not much skilled I am also learning.
